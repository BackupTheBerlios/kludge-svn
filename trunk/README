Kludge Version 1 readme

This program is meant to read data from some input (dummy or uart currently)
and present it on screen (in form of  color-changing  small shapes over some
image). It can also save  obtained  data in xml file  (its own format  and a
stupid one - I want to move to HDF some day); later the data can be replayed 
in kind-of real-time fasion.  Everything the program does (not much) is des-
cribed by  configuration files (in XML format, of course). Xercesc-C is used 
(via SAX api) to  read and  validate data  and  configuration  files against 
schemas  (kludgedata.xsd  and  kludge.xsd).  You'll   need  version  2.7  of 
Xercesc-C (www.apache.org/xml) to build it correctly.
Beyond this: the Jamfile and Jamrules are written for Jam/MR Version 2.3.2 (
I've got it from freetype project  page on  sourceforge). They will probably
work with other versions (nothing fancy inside).
Cairo  and glitz are  needed  (http://www.freedesktop.org). May be I'll lift 
the dependency on glitz some day. KDE-3 libraries are  needed too (Qt is not 
enough).
